# Smart Attendance App
 This is an Android application, in this app we take attendance using graphical user interface just by pressing roll number buttons to mark present or absent. We can also generate day wise and monthly reports of attendance. Also, we can store Unit Test marks and send SMS to studentâ€™s registered mobile number.
